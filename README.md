# Energy Analysis and predictions

# Energy price
Electricity price  is set at the point where supply and demand come together. The installations generating electricity with the lowest variable costs are dispatched first on the electricity market (merit order). This minimises the cost of supplying electricity. The price of electricity on the exchange generally corresponds to the variable costs of the most expensive generating installation in use.\


# In Germany specific

Germany used to be in a single bidding zone with Luxembourg and Austria, meaning that electricity could be traded on the wholesale market between the three countries without limits and at the same price.

Since 1 October 2018 this area has included the Federal Republic of Germany and Luxembourg. A bidding zone means that the same electricity price on the exchange applies throughout.  Moreover, the bidding zone is coupled with the electricity markets of 15 other European states, so the electricity price on the exchange of the day-ahead market is calculated in a joint, coordinated process for the coupled markets
